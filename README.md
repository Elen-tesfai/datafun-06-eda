# Project 6: Custom EDA

## Project Overview
Project 6 integrates Python and Markdown to create a data story in a Jupyter Notebook. The project includes a virtual environment with popular libraries for data analytics, including pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and follows a common process for exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects.

## Dataset Overview
For this project, we will be using the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle, which includes information about passengers aboard the Titanic and their survival status.

## Data Sources
- NOAA Storm Events
- U.S. Census Bureau Carto Boundary File

## Metadata
- **Information about the database**: [NOAA Storm Events Metadata](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/faq)
- **Database structure changes**: The structure from NOAA was changed in 1996. Only the years 1998-2024 are included in this download.

## Questions to Explore
- What states have the most events related to thunderstorms?
- Do some states have more tornadoes than others?
- Do stronger tornadoes result in more deaths?

## Visualizations
Consider adding relevant visualizations such as graphs or charts to illustrate your findings. You can use libraries like matplotlib or seaborn to create these visualizations and save them as images for your report.

## Lessons Learned
- Don't try to upload large CSV files to GitHub; it can be cumbersome to manage.
- Data format is crucial; mismatched data types can complicate analysis.

## Getting Started
### Create and Activate Project Virtual Environment
To set up your project environment, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
py -m venv .venv
